# Digitizing Old Physical Photographs
This project focuses on developing a solution for digitizing and restoring old physical photographs using a combination of traditional computer vision techniques. The goal is to enhance the quality of vintage images, remove noise, and reconstruct missing details to create high-resolution digital versions.

## Project Impact
This project not only contributes to preserving cultural and personal histories by digitizing old photographs but also showcases the effectiveness of traditional computer vision techniques in image restoration. The skills acquired during this project can be applied to various domains involving image enhancement and restoration.
